# Alarm Clock

I needed a new alarm clock.

Found a spare RasPi 3, installed Raspbian and NodeJS.

Bolted an Express API onto Bull and OMXPlayer.

## Todo
 - Web frontend
 - Stop alarm sound
 - Loop alarm sound until stopped
 - Snooze

### Eventually
 - Replace OMXPlayer with cross-platform option
 - Philips Hue / lighting integration (recall scene on alarm)
 - GPIO input
